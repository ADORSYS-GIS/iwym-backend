## Technical Resume for IWYM

### **Project Overview**

The local payment processor solution aims to create a Stripe-like system tailored for the Cameroonian market, enabling
merchants to accept payments via local mobile money providers such as MTN Mobile Money and Orange Money. The platform
supports both RESTful and RPC APIs, offering scalability, security, and efficiency to merchants and developers.

## **Core Technical Features**

### **Backend**

- **Framework**: Fully built using **Rust** for high performance and memory safety.
- **API Design**:
    - **RPC API**: Optimized for internal and trusted high-performance clients, using CBOR for compact payloads.
    - **Webhooks**: Real-time notifications for payment status updates and external events.
    - **Websockets**: For real-time transaction updates and notifications.
- **Authentication**:
    - **Keycloak**: Centralized authentication and authorization management.
    - JWT tokens for user sessions.
    - API keys for merchant access.
- **Database**:
    - **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational database for structured data and multi-tenancy support.
    - Features include schema separation for tenant data and indexing for high-performance queries.
- **Asynchronous Processing**:
    - **Event-Driven Architecture**: Handles long-running and external API calls with internal async tasks.
- **Immutable Data Storage**:
    - **Minio** (S3-compatible): Stores receipts, invoices, proof-of-purchase PDFs, user-uploaded documents, and
      snapshots.

### **Frontend**

- **Framework**: Built with **Next.js** for a fast and interactive merchant dashboard.
- **Features**:
    - Real-time transaction updates.
    - Tools for managing accounts, initiating payouts, and accessing reports.
    - Responsive and user-friendly interface.

### **Infrastructure**

- **Kubernetes (EKS or GKE)**:
    - Container orchestration for deployment, scaling, and management.
    - Separate namespaces for dev, staging, and production environments.
- **Docker**:
    - Ensures reproducible development environments.
- **Monitoring and Logging**:
    - **Prometheus and Grafana**: For metrics and visualizations.
    - **Sentry**: Centralized error tracking and debugging.
- **Storage**:
    - Minio integrated with optional CDN for efficient asset delivery.

### **Security**

- **Encryption**:
    - HTTPS for all data transfer.
    - mTLS for service-to-service communication within Kubernetes.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
    - Tailored roles for admins, merchants, and customers.
- **SSDLC Practices**:
    - Automated code scans (RustSec, Clippy).
    - Secure code reviews and threat modeling.
    - Continuous penetration testing.

## **Key Ideas and Concepts**

### **Dual API System**

- **REST API**:
    - Serves as the standard interface for external clients.
    - Follows OpenAPI specifications to ensure clarity and documentation.
- **RPC API**:
    - Provides a single endpoint (`/rpc`) for compact, CBOR-encoded payloads.
    - Supports batching requests (`/rpc.batch`) for optimized client-server interactions.

### **Multi-Tenancy Architecture**

- Tenant isolation using PostgreSQL schema separation.
- Scalable to support thousands of merchants without impacting performance.

### **Event-Driven Architecture**

- Asynchronous tasks for:
    - Payment status updates.
    - Webhook notifications.
    - External API integrations (e.g., MTN, Orange Money).

### **Storage Strategy**

- **Minio** for immutable data storage:
    - Ensures receipts, invoices, and documents remain tamper-proof.
    - Efficient integration with the backend for automated uploads.

### **Monitoring and Resilience**

- Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) for dynamic scaling based on traffic and load.
- Circuit breakers and retries for external API failures to ensure system stability.
