# ARC42 Template for Local Payment Processor Solution (Stripe-like System)

---

### 1. Introduction and Goals

#### Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **local payment processor** akin to Stripe, specifically tailored for the Cameroonian market. The solution will empower **merchants** to accept payments via **local mobile money platforms** such as MTN Mobile Money and Orange Money. Initially scoped as a **proof of concept (PoC)**, this system will support additional features and services, such as **cross-border payments** and multi-tenancy, to accommodate future expansion.

The platform provides merchants with a **RESTful API** for payment processing, **SDKs and plugins** for easy integration, and a **dashboard interface** to monitor transactions, manage funds, and perform financial operations. Our primary focus is a **scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution** that can leverage cloud-native features and integrate with **Kubernetes (EKS)** for autoscaling and resilience.

#### Primary Goals
1. **Simplify Payment Integration**: Provide developers and merchants with **API and SDK tools** for easy implementation of mobile payments and support for plug-and-play integrations.
2. **Ensure Security**: Implement end-to-end encryption, **API key and JWT authentication**, and a **double-entry ledger** for secure and traceable transactions.
3. **Scale with Demand**: Utilize Kubernetes to dynamically scale service instances, managing traffic spikes and high transaction volumes.
4. **Optimize Cost Efficiency**: Rely on open-source frameworks like **NestJS** and **PostgreSQL** and deploy on managed, cost-effective Kubernetes services.

#### Non-Goals
- No **credit card support**: This phase focuses on mobile money payments only.
- No **international payment support**: Local transactions only; international expansion may be scoped later.

### 3. Context and Scope

#### System Context
The local payment processor acts as an intermediary between **merchants** and **mobile money providers** (MTN MoMo and Orange Money). It provides **API endpoints** for merchants to initiate transactions, a **dashboard for monitoring and managing accounts**, and backend services to handle **webhooks, payment processing,** and **payouts**.

#### Primary Actors
1. **Merchants**: Businesses or individuals utilizing the API for payment processing, integrating it with their platforms, and managing their funds via the dashboard.
2. **Customers**: Individuals completing payments using their mobile money wallets.
3. **Administrator**: Internal user responsible for **account validation**, handling **sandbox-to-production transitions**, and **merchant account management**.
4. **Payment Providers**: External systems (e.g., MTN MoMo, Orange Money) that process transactions and provide payment confirmations.

---

### 4. Solution Strategy

#### Technology Choices
- **Backend**: **NestJS** with microservices and TypeORM for seamless integration with **PostgreSQL**.
- **Frontend**: **Next.js** to build a dynamic, interactive dashboard with real-time transaction visibility.
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL 13** as the primary database, supporting structured data and multi-tenant operations.
- **Event Queue**: **BullMQ** and **Redis** to support asynchronous processing, queued tasks, and webhook notifications.
- **Storage**: **S3-compatible storage (Minio)** for assets such as transaction records, invoices, and profiles.

#### Security Strategy
1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
    - JWT authentication for users and **API key-based** access for merchants.
    - **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** to manage permissions across different roles (Admin, Merchant, Client).
2. **Encryption**: All communication (internal and external) secured with HTTPS and mTLS (for Kubernetes services).
3. **Input Validation and Rate Limiting**: Enforce validation to mitigate injection attacks and implement rate limiting to avoid abuse.

#### Resilience Strategy
- **Global Error Handling**: Implement centralized error handling across services and integrate with **Sentry** for error tracking.
- **Auto-Scaling and Failover**: Deploy with **Kubernetes HPA** to handle scaling and **cluster failover** to improve availability.

### 5. Building Block View (Architecture Overview)

#### Core Components
1. **API Gateway (NestJS)**:
    - Centralized service for routing API requests and enforcing authentication and authorization.
    - Routes requests to appropriate services, including **Payment Service**, **Customer Service**, and **Merchant Service**.

2. **Merchant Dashboard (Frontend)**:
    - Built with **Next.js** for an interactive, real-time dashboard where merchants can manage transactions, request payouts, and access reports.

3. **Microservices**:
    - **Payment Service**: Manages payment initiation, status checks, and error handling.
    - **Customer Service**: Manages customer actions, including payment setup and subscriptions.
    - **Merchant Service**: Handles merchant account details, API key issuance, and other business logic.
    - **Webhook Service**: Dedicated service for sending real-time notifications to external systems.

4. **Event Queue (Redis + BullMQ)**:
    - Manages long-running and asynchronous tasks, especially related to external API calls and event-driven processing.

5. **Database (PostgreSQL)**:
    - Primary storage with support for structured data, multi-tenancy, and full-text search.

6. **Storage Service (Minio)**:
    - Stores static files (images, styles) and dynamic content (invoices, profile pictures).

### 6. Runtime View

#### Example Workflow: Payment Process
1. **Merchant Setup**: A merchant creates an account, obtains API credentials, and configures payment settings.
2. **Payment Initiation**:
    - A customer initiates payment via the merchantâ€™s platform, triggering an API call to the **Payment Service**.
    - The **API Gateway** routes the request to the appropriate service, which then places a job in **BullMQ** to call the mobile money API (e.g., MTN MoMo).
3. **Payment Processing**:
    - Upon confirmation, the transaction is recorded in the **PostgreSQL ledger**, maintaining a double-entry for debit and credit.
    - The **Payment Service** sends a real-time update to the merchant's dashboard and, if applicable, a webhook to external systems.

### 7. Deployment View

#### Infrastructure Components
1. **Kubernetes Cluster**: EKS or GKE, with separate namespaces for dev, staging, and production.
2. **Service Pods**: Each microservice (e.g., Payment Service, Webhook Service) is deployed as a separate pod, managed by Helm.
3. **Redis**: Dedicated Redis instance for BullMQ to handle message queues and inter-service communication.
4. **PostgreSQL**: Cloud-hosted database (Neon.tech for PoC, AWS RDS for production).
5. **S3 Storage (Minio)**: S3-compatible storage for file management, optionally connected to a CDN.
