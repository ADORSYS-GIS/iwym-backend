## 1. Introduction and Goals

### Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **local payment processor** akin to Stripe, specifically tailored for the Cameroonian
market. The solution will empower **merchants** to accept payments via **local mobile money platforms** such as MTN
Mobile Money and Orange Money. Initially scoped as a **proof of concept (PoC)**, this system will support additional
features and services, such as **cross-border payments** and multi-tenancy, to accommodate future expansion.

The platform provides merchants with a **RESTful API** and **RPC API** for payment processing, **SDKs and plugins** for
easy integration, and a **dashboard interface** to monitor transactions, manage funds, and perform financial operations.
Our primary focus is a **scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution** that leverages cloud-native features and
integrates with **Kubernetes (EKS)** for autoscaling and resilience.

### Primary Goals

1. **Simplify Payment Integration**: Provide developers and merchants with **API and SDK tools** for easy implementation
   of mobile payments and support for plug-and-play integrations.
2. **Ensure Security**: Implement end-to-end encryption, **API key and JWT authentication**, and a **double-entry ledger
   ** for secure and traceable transactions.
3. **Scale with Demand**: Utilize Kubernetes to dynamically scale service instances, managing traffic spikes and high
   transaction volumes.
4. **Optimize Cost Efficiency**: Transition fully to **Rust-based high-performance backend** and **PostgreSQL**.
5. **Reproducible Development Environments**: Use **Docker** to ensure consistent and reproducible development setups.

### Non-Goals

- No **credit card support**: This phase focuses on mobile money payments only.
- No **international payment support**: Local transactions only; international expansion may be scoped later.

## 3. Context and Scope

### System Context

The local payment processor acts as an intermediary between **merchants** and **mobile money providers** (MTN MoMo and
Orange Money). It provides **API endpoints** for merchants to initiate transactions, a **dashboard for monitoring and
managing accounts**, and backend services to handle **webhooks, payment processing,** and **payouts**.

### Primary Actors

1. **Merchants**: Businesses or individuals utilizing the API for payment processing, integrating it with their
   platforms, and managing their funds via the dashboard.
2. **Customers**: Individuals completing payments using their mobile money wallets.
3. **Administrator**: Internal user responsible for **account validation**, handling **sandbox-to-production transitions
   **, and **merchant account management**.
4. **Payment Providers**: External systems (e.g., MTN MoMo, Orange Money) that process transactions and provide payment
   confirmations.

## 5. Building Block View (Architecture Overview)

### Core Components

1. **API Gateway (Rust)**:

    - Centralized service for routing API requests and enforcing authentication and authorization.
    - Routes requests to appropriate services, including **Payment Service**, **Customer Service**, and **Merchant
      Service**.

2. **Merchant Dashboard (Frontend)**:

    - Built with **Next.js** for an interactive, real-time dashboard where merchants can manage transactions, request
      payouts, and access reports.

3. **Microservices**:

    - **Payment Service**: Manages payment initiation, status checks, and error handling.
    - **Customer Service**: Manages customer actions, including payment setup and subscriptions.
    - **Merchant Service**: Handles merchant account details, API key issuance, and other business logic.
    - **Webhook Service**: Dedicated service for sending real-time notifications to external systems.

4. **Database (PostgreSQL)**:

    - Primary storage with support for structured data, multi-tenancy, and full-text search.

5. **Storage Service (Minio)**:

    - Stores immutable data such as receipts, invoices, proof-of-purchase PDFs, user-uploaded documents, and backups.

## 6. Runtime View

### Example Workflow: Payment Process

1. **Merchant Setup**: A merchant creates an account, obtains API credentials, and configures payment settings.
2. **Payment Initiation**:
    - A customer initiates payment via the merchantâ€™s platform, triggering an API call to the **Payment Service**.
    - The **API Gateway** routes the request to the appropriate service.
3. **Payment Processing**:
    - Upon confirmation, the transaction is recorded in the **PostgreSQL ledger**, maintaining a double-entry for debit
      and credit.
    - The **Payment Service** sends a real-time update to the merchant's dashboard and, if applicable, a webhook to
      external systems.

### Runtime Diagram
